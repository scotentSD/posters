We want these posters to be available in as many languages as possible. You are welcome to localise the posters.

We only ask you to make available publicly.

**Help**

Here's a suggested way to localise the posters:

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters)
2. Using [the SVG files provided](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility/posters_en-UK/svg) you can localise the posters
3. Add 2 or 3 letter language code to the end of each poster - e.g. "screenreader_fr.pdf."
4. Send a pull request so we can review and merge them.

We're happy to adapt the localisation process, so if you have any suggestions [create a new issue](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/issues).

**Same language but different countries**

NB: If there are a number of people who want to localise the posters into other languages, we'll ask you to
collaborate to make one set of posters.

If there are differences between e.g. Spanish spoken in Spain and Spanish spoken in Argentina, then it is possible
to create two localised versions - one for Spain and one for Argentina.

**Support**

If you have any questions, just ask a question [by creating a new issue](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/issues)!
