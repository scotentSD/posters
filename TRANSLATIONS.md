We want these posters to be available in as many languages as possible. You are welcome to translate the posters.

We only ask you to make available publicly.

**Help**
A possibly way to translate the posters:

1. [clone the repository](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters)
2. translate them
3. Add 2 or 3 letter language code to the end of each poster - e.g. "screenreader_fr.pdf."
4. send a pull request so we can merge them, or tell us where they are so we can advertise them here.

If you have any questions, just ask!
